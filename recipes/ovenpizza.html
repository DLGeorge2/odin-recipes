            <p><strong>Here is what you'll need:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A packet of instant yeast</li>
                    <li>1 and 1/3 cup of warm water</li>
                    <li>3 and 1/2 cups Unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive olive</li>
                    <li>a sprinkle of cornmeal for dusting the pan</li>

                </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. If you don’t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula in the next step.</li>
                    <li>Add olive oil, salt and flour. Beat on low for 2 minutes. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead 3-4 minutes until dough is soft. You should be able to poke the dough with a finger and it will bounce back.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place dough in the bowl and turn until it is coated with oil. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 60-90 minutes. Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Allow it to heat for 15-20 minutes while you shape the pizza. Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal.</li>
                    <li>When the dough is read, punch it down to release any air bubble. Divide roughly in half. On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or a rolling pin, gently flatted the dough into a disc. Place on the prepared pan, using your hands to stretch and flatted the disc into a 12-inch circle. Lift the edge of the dough to create a lip. </li>
                    <li>Cover dough and let it rest as you prepare your toppings.</li>
                    <li>Top and bake your pizza. To prevent filling from making your crust soggy, brush the top lightly with oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Add toppings and bake for 12-15 minutes. </li>
                     </ol>
